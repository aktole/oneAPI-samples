### Introduction to oneAPI FPGA Board Support Package(BSP)

A oneAPI board support package (BSP) consists of software layers and an FPGA hardware scaffold design that makes it possible to target the FPGA through the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler. The FPGA design generated by the compiler is stitched into the framework provided by the oneAPI BSP. Please see information about oneAPI BSPs in [oneAPI Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/programming-interface/fpga-flow/fpga-bsps-and-boards.html). 


The BSP hardware components typically comprise RTL for all interfaces required by the oneAPI kernel, for example a PCIe IP for host to kernel communication, EMIF (External Memory Interface) IP for kernel to memory as well as host to FPGA board memory communication etc.

The BSP software components typically consists of a Memory Mapped Device (MMD) layer and a driver. The implementation is vendor dependent.


The block diagram below shows an overview of a typical oneAPI FPGA BSP hardware design. The numbered arrows depict the following:
* Path 1 depicts host to device global memory interface
* Path 2 depicts host to kernel interface
* Path 3 shows kernel to device global memory interface

oneAPI BSP consists of components operating at different clock domains. PCIe and external memories operate at a fixed frequency. Corresponding RTL IPs are parametrized to operate at these fixed frequencies by platform vendors.
Kernel clock frequency is variable and is calculated as a part of oneAPI offline compilation flow for FPGAs. The BSP has logic to handle the transfer of data across these clock domains.

`board_test` measures the frequency that the kernel is running at in the FPGA and compares this to compiled kernel clock frequency. [Test Details](#test-details) section provides more information.

*Note:* The block diagram shown below is an overview of a typical oneAPI FPGA platform. Please refer to oneAPI platform/BSP vendor documentation for more details on platform components.

### Test Details
The complete test exercises following interfaces in a platform:
1. **Host to device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing explicit data movement between the host and device global memory. Host to device global memory bandwidth is measured and reported. As a part of this interface check, unaligned data transfers are also performed to verify non-DMA transfers complete successfully.

2. **Kernel to device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing kernel to memory data transfers using simple read and write kernels. Kernel to memory bandwidth is measured and reported.<br> 
*Note:* This test currently does not support SYCL Unified Shared Memory (USM). For testing USM interface, please use [Simple host streaming sample](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/DesignPatterns/simple_host_streaming).

3. **Host to kernel interface:** The test ensures the host to kernel communication is correct and that the host can launch a kernel successfully. It also measures the roundtrip kernel launch latency and throughput (number of kernels/ms) of single task no-operation kernels.

In addition to the above interface checks, the test also measures the **Kernel clock frequency**. The test measures the frequency that the programmed kernel is running at on the FPGA device and reports it. By default, this test fails if the measured frequency is not within 2% of the compiled frequency.<br>
*Note:* The test allows overriding this failure, however, this is may lead to functional errors and is not recommended. The override option is provided to allow debug in case where platform design changes are done to force kernel to run at slower clock (this is not a common use-case). Usage section describes how to override this option if required.

The complete test is divided into six sub-tests. By default, all tests are run. You can choose to run a single test using `-test=<test number>` option. Please see [Running the Sample](#running-the-sample) for test usage instructions.
1. Host Speed and Host Read Write Test
2. Kernel Clock Frequency Test
3. Kernel Launch Test
4. Kernel Latency Measurement
5. Kernel-to-Memory Read Write Test
6. Kernel-to-Memory Bandwidth Test<br>
*Note:* It is recommended to run all tests at least once to ensure that the platform interfaces are fully functional.

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `$ONEAPI_ROOT/dev-utilities/latest/include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_a10gx_pac:pac_a10 ..
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> ..
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (compiles quickly, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (takes longer to compile, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA pre-compiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/board_test.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html)


## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `board_test.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

You may also wish to examine the reports generated by the full FPGA hardware compile and compare their contents.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./board_test.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./board_test.fpga         (Linux)
     ```
The above commands run all the test described in [Test Details](#test-details), to run a specific test pass the test number as argument to `-test=<test number>` option: 
```
./board_test.fpga -test=<test number>     (Linux)
```
`Test number` should be one of the following:
1. Host Speed and Host Read Write Test
2. Kernel Clock Frequency Test
3. Kernel Launch Test
4. Kernel Latency Measurement
5. Kernel-to-Memory Read Write Test
6. Kernel-to-Memory Bandwidth Test

This test has 2 additional requirements to run successfully. 

1. Requirement for the kernel clock frequency test: The reports directory (generated after full compilation) must be in one of the following locations:
* Same directory as `board_test.fpga` binary
* Inside `board_test.prj` folder in the same directory as `board_test.fpga` binary
If the reports folder is not found, the test will return the measured kernel clock frequency and fail, none of the other tests will run as hardware frequency may not be the expected value. Continuing to run other tests may lead to functional errors.<br>
*Note:* The test allows overriding this failure, however, this is may lead to functional errors and is not recommended. The override option is provided to allow debug in case where platform design changes are done to force kernel to run at slower clock (this is not a common use-case). To override, set `report_chk` variable to `false` in `board_test.cpp` and recompile host code only using `-reuse-exe=board_test.fpga` option in compile command.

2. Requirement for kernel-to-memory bandwidth test: Export `HLD_SHIM_ROOT_HW` to point to `path-to-oneAPI-shim/hardware/<board_variant>` directory. The test looks for `board_spec.xml` file in this folder to get the global memory information for the board. The test does not fail if this variable is not set, it reports measured kernel to device global memory bandwidth numbers and continues. 

To view test details and usage information using the binary, use `-help` option.
```
./board_test.fpga -help      (Linux)
```
